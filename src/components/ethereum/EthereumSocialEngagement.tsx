            In 2025, community traction isn't a side benefit — it's core infrastructure. Ethereum launchpads that drive 
            social visibility consistently outperform those that don't, regardless of technical merit or project stage.

Bright lines extend outwards, connecting to various social media icons like Twitter birds, 'like' thumbs-up, heart symbols, and Instagram logos, all glowing with neon pink, blue, and orange. In the background, a rising green graph line symbolizes growth and momentum, while blurred silhouettes of people suggest community engagement. The image powerfully illustrates how social visibility drives momentum for Ethereum token launches."

              DAO Maker and Poolz lead not just in project count but in attention. Their Twitter activity averages tens 
              of thousands of views per tweet, with hundreds of interactions on launch-related announcements. This visibility 
              translates into wallet sign-ups, allowlist applications, and launch traffic.

              Seedify, despite a high launch volume, shows limited traction per post. Most tweets see fewer than 10 favorites 
              and under 1,000 views — a signal that reach alone does not equal engagement.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Strong social velocity isn't just about impressions — it's about perceived legitimacy. Founders and early 
              investors look to community reactions as early signals. A tweet with real engagement often does more for 
              trust than a press release.

            <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-primary/20 to-secondary/20 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <p className="text-foreground font-medium">
                If a launchpad consistently drives positive sentiment around its projects, that trust loops back into 
                future deal flow. Platforms that ignore this are simply leaving adoption on the table.
